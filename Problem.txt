Write a program in Java that can return an array in descending order of elements using insertion sort.
The program will take the size of the array and the elements of the array as inputs.
Sample Input: 
4
1
2
3
4
Sample Output:
4
3
2
1

Here, input value ‘4’ (the first input) corresponds to the array size, and the rest of the numbers correspond to the elements of the array.
